= istio-java-api

A project to generate a Java API for https://istio.io[Istio]'s domain allowing, in particular, the generation of Istio deployment
descriptors. This project is inspired by https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-model[Fabric8's kubernetes-model] and relies on
the same approach: a Go program uses Go reflection to generate a http://json-schema.org[JSON Schema] which is then used by
https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo[jsonschema2pojo] to generate Java classes, enriched by annotations
(https://github.com/fasterxml/jackson[Jackson] and https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380[Bean Validation - JSR 380] notably,
though custom annotations can also be used). Jackson is then used to output JSON or YAML representation of the Java objects when
needed.

= Usage

Please take a look at the tests in `istio-model/src/test/java` to see how the API can be used. You can also take a look at the
https://github.com/metacosm/istio-test-dsl project which demonstrates an end-to-end scenario using the Fabric8 OpenShift adapter
and this API to send Istio artifacts to a running OpenShift cluster configured on which Istio is set up.

= Building instructions

If you only want to build the current version of the API and don't intend on modifying how the JSON Schema is generated, you can build simply using `mvn clean install` as the project contains a pre-generated version of the schema. If you need to re-generate the classes from a newer version of the API, please see below.

== Initial setup

You will need to set up your environment for Go programming (`GOPATH` setup with the proper directory hierarchy):

  . cd $GOPATH/src
  . git clone git@github.com:istio/api.git istio.io/api
  . cd istio.io/api
  . ./scripts/generate-protos.sh

These steps put the API code in the proper spot with the proper https://github.com/istio/api/blob/master/BUILD#L2[organization prefix]. The `generate-protos.sh` script will re-generate the Go files base on the protobuf definitions if needed but also make sure that you have all the required dependencies.

== Building the Java API

Run `make`. This will build the `generate` command line tool from Go and then run it to generate a JSON Schema in
`istio-model/src/main/resources/schema/istio-schema.json`. A Maven build
is then issued using the `jsonschema2pojo` Maven plugin to generate Java classes in `istio-model/target/generated-sources` and
generate a Jar file containing the compiled version of these classes along with the JSON schema, ready to be used.

You can clean everything using `make clean`, only generate the schema using `make schema` or only generate the Java classes (assuming a schema already exists) using `mvn clean install`.
